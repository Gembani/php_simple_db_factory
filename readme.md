#Simple db Factory
Simple DB Factory will be a framework agnostic way of populating a mysql database for testing purposes. 

I tried using Factory but I found that it wasn't framework agnostic, so not useful for the legacy projects that need to be tested in my organisation.
 
##Development TODO

This is just 4 hours of coding. Hopefully I'll work more on it later. 

Allow for using sequences.
Allow for using foreign keys.
Truncate mode and transaction rollback mode (for speed)
